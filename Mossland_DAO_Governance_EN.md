# Mossland DAO Governance
- Posted on: July 18, 2022
- Version: 0.3
- Purpose: This document was written for the purpose of researching the governance model of a decentralized organization (DAO) for the Mossland project.

## Mossland Governance

Mossland started as a blockchain-based metaverse project that connects the real and virtual worlds. Mossland project’s ecosystem funds are managed through Mossland DAO, a decentralized governance framework. We expect that the Mossland DAO will further align the future of the Mossland project in the direction desired by Mosscoin holders. The Mossland DAO follows a proposal process in which the Mossland Foundation votes on how ecosystem funds will be distributed to promote a diverse and self-sufficient ecosystem. This document provides an overview of the Mossland DAO's proposal process and may be improved with input from the DAO community.

## Mossland Vision
Mossland is a blockchain-based metaverse project that connects the real and virtual worlds, pursuing the realization of a hyper-connected world. Mossland's ultimate goal is to realize hyper-connected technology and contribute to human society through the pursuit of core values ​​and mission.

## Membership

Submission of ideas, comments, submissions of proposals and participation in voting are restricted to Mossland DAO Members. By holding Moss Coin, you become a member of the DAO.

### Communication Channel
The Mossland website provides DAO members with explanations about the governance process and uses various 3rd party solutions such as Discord and Snapshot as communication channels between DAO members. All proposals will begin with a MIP (Mossland Idea Proposal) Idea. Ideas are submitted as posts on the Discourse communication channel and must be confirmed by Moderators that they complied with DAO approved guidelines before postings are made public. In order to post Ideas or to post feedback on ideas through comments, you must go through the wallet verification process for holding Moss Coin.

## Proposal Process
Mossland DAO is implemented by the Luniverse platform and operated with community-driven governance through the Mossland DAO official proposal process.

## Proposal Category

There are three main categories of MIP (Mossland Improvement Proposal): Core, Process, or Informational. The Core proposal has two subcategories: Brand Determination and Ecosystem Fund Allocation. Resubmitted proposals should be classified as such.

Core: Suggestions on how to allocate DAO funds for allocating ecosystem funds.
Core: Resubmission of Ecosystem Funding Resubmission proposals on how DAO funds will be utilized.
Core: Proposals for brands created by the DAO, including brand decision projects and collaborations
Core: Resubmission of brands created by DAO, including Resubmission projects and collaborations
Process A proposal to change a process or implementation. Examples include changes to procedures, guidelines, decision-making processes, changes to DAO or Foundation tools or environments.
Process (Resubmission) Resubmitting a proposal to change a process or implementation
General guidance or suggestions for information to the Informational community.
Resubmit suggestions for general guidance or information to the Informational (Resubmission) community.

**Proposal Template **

Offers usually include:

- Abstract - A two or three sentence summary that summarizes the proposal.
- Motivation - Why the Mossland community should implement the proposal
- Rationale - A description of how the proposal aligns with the vision and mission of the Mossland community.
- Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies to use.
- Steps to Implement - for implementing the proposal. A description of the resource, such as cost and manpower.
- Timeline - Details about the schedule, including start and finish dates.
- Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal.

Authors can add additional fields as needed to convey the intent, detail and meaning of the MIP draft.

- Proposals that are resubmitted without going through the appropriate approval process must be included 
- Original suggestion link
- Reason for not being approved
- What has changed and why it should now be approved

## Proposal process

- Step 1: MIP Idea
  - MIP Ideas are submitted as posts on Discourse and must be confirmed by Moderators that they comply with DAO-approved guidelines before they appear in the community. People who submit MIP Ideas are called Authors or Authors (multiple members can work together on a MIP Idea, but only submit once for the same idea). MIP Idea collects opinions informally through Discourse over 7 days. Authors cannot edit the original post. If authors want to suggest changes to the original idea, they must make corrections through comments.

-Step 2: MIP Draft
  - After the 7-day feedback period and the Moderator closes the discussion topic, the Moderator sends a Proposal Template to the Author. Then proceed to the next step for Submission and Voting.
Author creates Template by integrating Discourse feedback on Idea. Moderators can notify Authors of any corrections, such as errors, inaccuracies, or missing information. - If the author does not respond to the moderator request within 30 days, the MIP draft is automatically rejected.
When the moderator verifies that the MIP draft complies with the DAO-approved Guidelines, it assigns an identification number to the MIP. From this point on, the MIP will be referred to as "MIP-#: (Name) - (Category)". For example, the first MIP is "MIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process".

- Step 3: MIP Analysis Report
  -The Project Management Team associated with the Mossland Foundation analyzes the content of the MIP Draft to create a MIP Analysis Report detailing costs, implementation, legal considerations, and potential conflicts of interest. The purpose of this is to enable DAO Members to vote based on more professionally analyzed information.
- Step 4: MIP Moderation
  - The MIP Draft + Analysis Report (DAR) Package is reviewed by a team of Moderators and approved based on compliance with DAO-approved guidelines. If approved, it becomes a Pending MIP and moves on to Step 5. Unapproved DAR Packages may be resubmitted unless there is a reasonable suspicion of violating the law or of fraud or other misleading information.

- Step 5: Post-moderation Tagging
  - Pending MIPs that pass MIP Moderation are tagged as "Straight to Vote" or "Needs Administrative Review."
The "Straight to Vote" tag is awarded to Pending MIPs that are judged to be simple in cost, content and meaning and pose no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Pending MIPs tagged "Straight to Vote" will be transferred directly to Step 7.
The "Needs Administrative Review" tag is awarded to Pending MIPs that are deemed complex in cost, content, or meaning or pose a potential risk to the well-being of the DAO. Pending MIPs tagged with "Needs Administrative Review" must go through step 6.

- Step 6: Administrative Review
  - Pending MIPs tagged "Needs Administrative Review" by the Mossland BOARD will be returned by the Mossland BOARD, require further action, or go to Step 7. If the Mossland BOARD decides to return the MIP, it should provide a clear explanation of the reason and provide a "Return for Clarification" or "Return for Reconstruction." Tag: "Approved for Voting" if no further action is required.

  - Reasons for tagging as "Return for Clarification" include, but are not limited to:
  - Implementation cost unclear/uncalculable
  - Use more than 5% of DAO funds
  - Conflict with other offers

 - Reasons for tagging as "Return for Reconstruction" include, but are not limited to:

  - Proposal goes against DAO's Mossland vision and mission
  - Proposal conflicts with DAO's well-being
  - Violation of the law or against the advice of an attorney at the Mossland Foundation
  - Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information
- Step 7: Live MIP
  - Passed MIPs will be released as Live MIPs every Thursday at 9:00 PM (GMT+9). Live MIP will be voted on by DAO Members until the following Wednesday at 9PM (GMT+9) after launch. Moderators have the right to publish Live MIPs.
- Step 8: Final MIP
  - Live MIP is classified as Accepted Final MIP or Rejected Final MIP according to the voting result. If you do not receive a vote or are tied at the voting deadline, you will be tagged as "Stalled" and can resubmit. Rejected Final MIP can be resubmitted to Moderator by Author filling out Resubmission Template. Accepted Final MIPs go to Implementation.
- Step 9: Implementation
  - In case of Accepted Final MIP, implementation starts based on the contents of the MIP Template. The Project Management Team associated with the Mossland Foundation is responsible for helping implement the Accepted Final MIP, but is not responsible for implementing it itself.

### Proposal Conflict
  - If a proposed proposal conflicts with a proposal currently being voted on, the second proposal will not go to vote until a decision has been made on the first proposal to avoid approval of the opposing requirement. Proposal proposals that directly conflict with other approved proposals cannot be voted on for 3 months after the original proposal is implemented to avoid wasting community assets.

## Vote
Mossland DAO’s consensus mechanism aims to make voting fair, transparent and affordable so that Mosscoin holders can participate in the DAO’s decision-making.

#### Voting Mechanism
Snapshot was chosen as the voting tool for:

- No gas payment required
- Ensure transparency
- Expanding governance participation opportunities to all Mosscoin holders

### Voting Procedure

1. After the moderator verifies that the MIP has gone through the correct approval process, it publishes the MIP to a Snapshot. New MIPs are posted every Thursday at 9:00 PM (GMT+9). This is the start of the six-day voting period.
2. DAO members vote for Snapshot. 1 Mosscoin can cast 1 vote. If a voter owns a small number of tokens, the number of votes is rounded down. (i.e., 100.1 tokens and 100.9 tokens equal 100 votes.) The voting options for Live MIP are “In favor” and “Against”. A “yes” vote means that the voters are in favor of implementing the MIP as-is. Vote "No" means you vote against the as-is implementation of the MIP. You can vote "No" to encourage Authors to resubmit the MIP after making changes.
3. Voting for each proposal is open for six days and closes next Wednesday at 9:00 PM GMT+9.
4. Proposals that receive a majority “yes” vote are moved to Implementation. Rejected proposals can be resubmitted by the Author to the Moderator. If a Live <IP has not received a vote or is tied by the voting deadline, it will be tagged as "Stalled" and may be resubmitted.

## Checklist for DAO Application of Mossland Project

### Centralization Risk Checklist
1. Be able to propose changes to a system or network by the general public.
2. It should allow the general public to make changes to the system or network without the consent of the project team, or implement public proposals voted by the token holding community regardless of whether the project team agrees to the proposal. This should also include updates to network or system code that are not supported or developed by the project team.
3. Developers who are not affiliated with the project team or are not paying for it must be making significant contributions to the project. They must demonstrate that they are actively developing a network or system or are engaged in other essential tasks and responsibilities. For example) a pull request or commit in an open source repository.
4. An individual or group not part of the project team must be actively using the network or system for its intended purpose. Example) dApps, built projects, daily active users.

### Risk of active participation of the project team
1. If possible, the activity of the project team should be reduced so that it is no longer critical to the value or success of the project.
2. Whenever possible, the structure should be changed so that there are no project teams that the public regards as the team that centrally manages the tokens and the network.
3. You must not discuss or promote the background of the project team in token marketing.
4. If the project team is promoting widespread adoption and use of the network, it's a good idea to stop doing that.

## The Future of Mossland DAO

Over time, the Mossland DAO will transform its proposal and voting mechanism into a fully on-chain platform in a form determined by the community.

## REFERENCE

### GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. Every year there is a DAO vote to determine which DAO members will be on the Mossland Foundation's BOARD. The purpose of the BOARD is to manage the DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community. This initial board will run for 12 months.
2. BOARD members may be removed and replaced before the end of their term by a majority vote of token holders.
3. For a proposal to go to vote, the total cost of implementation must be clear.
4. DAO members should search past proposals to make sure that ideas for which they want to write a proposal have not yet been submitted.
5. If a proposed proposal directly conflicts with a proposal currently being voted on, the second proposal must not go to a vote until a decision has been made on the first proposal to avoid approval of the opposing requirement.
6. Proposal proposals that directly conflict with other approved proposals cannot be voted on for 3 months after the original proposal is implemented to avoid wasting community assets.
7. Proposals will not be voted on if they contain illegal activity, hate speech, pornography, or conflict with the mission or values ​​of the Mossland Foundation.
