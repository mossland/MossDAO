# [Mossland Improvement Proposals]

## MIP-1: Proposal to introduce DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for Mossland Project
- Author: Mossland
- Status: Idea
- Type: Core
- Created: 2022-07-18

### Rationale:
The introduction of DAO is to develop Mossland into an ecosystem that supports Moss coin holders' community-led initiatives.
As the Mossland projectâ€™s ecosystem funds are managed through the Mossland DAO, a decentralized governance framework, we expect the Mossland DAO to further align the future of the Mossland project with the direction desired by Mosscoin holders.
We believe that the introduction of DAO is very important to build and manage diversely distributed communities such as Mossland-related content production, cooperative projects, and support for secondary creations.

### Mossland DAO Overview
We would like to design a draft version of Mossland DAO Governance by hard forking the ApeCoin DAO Governance (https://apecoin.com/governance), which the Mossland team considers to be the most ideal model among the recently designed DAO projects.
Ultimately, the goal is for the DAO to be operated by Mosscoin holders, and various resources, including Mossland's funds, to be managed by the Mossland DAO.


### Mossland Governance Model
We designed a decentralized organization (DAO) governance model for the Mossland project.
The Governance Document outlines the Mossland DAO's proposal process and may be improved with input from the DAO community.

### Mossland DAO BOARD
The initial board members are made of the Mossland team and external personnel chosen by the Mossland team. The initial board member's term is set for 12 months. Any extension or changes to the board member will be decided through Mossland DAO. 

### Mossland DAO Management Team
The initial Mossland DAO team that will implement the decisions of Mossland DAO will be chosen from the Mossland team. For flexibility and scalability, Mossland DAO aims to determine the budget and role of the whole team rather than evaluating inidivual members by the Mossland DAO. Initial goals of the initial Mossland DAO management team, Mossland Team, are development of the initial DAO platform, DAO platform operational support, and marketing. After the initial goals, new goals and roles will be rechosen by the Mossland DAO.
