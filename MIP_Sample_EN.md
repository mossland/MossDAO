# [Mossland Improvement Proposals]

## MIP-1: Proposal to introduce DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for Mossland Project
- Author: Mossland
- Status: Idea
- Type: Core
- Created: 2022-07-18

### Rationale:
We propose the introduction of DAO to develop Mossland into an ecosystem that supports Moss coin holders and cyberdoug community-led initiatives.
As the Mossland projectâ€™s ecosystem funds are managed through the Mossland DAO, a decentralized governance framework, we expect the Mossland DAO to further align the future of the Mossland project with the direction desired by Mosscoin holders.
We believe that the introduction of DAO is very important to build and manage diversely distributed communities such as Mossland-related content production, cooperative projects, and support for secondary creations.

### Mossland DAO Overview
We would like to design a draft Mossland DAO by hard forking the ApeCoin DAO (https://apecoin.com/governance), which the Mossland team considers to be the most ideal model among the recently designed DAO projects.
Ultimately, the goal is for the DAO to be operated centered on Mosscoin holders, and various resources, including Mossland's funds, to be managed by the Mossland DAO.

### Mossland Governance Model
We designed a decentralized organization (DAO) governance model for the Mossland project.
The Governance Document outlines the Mossland DAO's proposal process and may be improved with input from the DAO community.

### Mossland DAO BOARD
The initial board members are elected and operated by the Mossland team and external personnel, and the initial board member's term is set for 12 months.

### Mossland DAO Management Team
The team that will implement the decisions made by the Mossland DAO. Initial team members are elected from the Mossland team. For flexibility and scalability, Mossland DAO aims to determine the budget and role of each team rather than managing the election of individual team members with Mossland DAO. Initially, the goals of the Mossland DAO Management Team, which were initially composed of Mossland team members, were set to develop the initial DAO platform, support the operation of the DAO platform, and market it. After that, the goals and roles aim to be reset by the Mossland DAO.
