# Mossland DAO

## 1. Mossland Vision Statement

Mossland is a blockchain-based metaverse project that connects the real and virtual worlds, a hyper-connected world. Mossland's ultimate goal is to develop this hyper-connected technology and contribute to human society through the pursuit of core values and mission.

## 2. What is the Mossland DAO?

Mossland owns and operates a variety of smart contracts and services, starting with the blockchain-based metaverse project that connects the real and virtual worlds. Mossland DAO owns major smart contracts and NFT contracts, service servers, and marketplaces related to the Mossland project, and manages the Mossland project’s ecosystem funds through a decentralized governance framework. The Mossland DAO follows a proposal process on how the Mossland Foundation allocates the ecosystem funds to promote a diverse and self-sufficient ecosystem. We expect that the Mossland DAO will further align the future of the Mossland project in the direction desired by Mosscoin holders.

The document below provides an overview of the Mossland DAO's proposal process and may be improved with input from the DAO community.
- [Mossland Governance Model](Mossland_DAO_Governance.md) 

### 2.1. Mossland Improvement Proposal

Mossland DAO is implemented on the Luniverse platform and operated with community-driven governance through the Mossland DAO official proposal process.

- [(Sample) MIP-1: Proposal for Introduction of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for Mossland Project](MIP_Sample.md) 


## 3. Why does Mossland Project need DAO integration?

Implementing a blockchain-based metaverse and decentralizing the full control of the metaverse was one of Mossland’s important goals. Moss Coin holders can participate in the detailed design, development and operation of the Mossland metaverse through the Mossland DAO. We expect that the Mossland DAO will further align the future of Mossland in the direction desired by Mosscoin holders.

## 4. How does Mossland DAO operate? 

Mossland DAO is implemented by the Luniverse platform and operated with community-driven governance through the Mossland DAO official proposal process. Mosscoin holders can become members of the DAO and submit ideas, comment, submit proposals, and participate in voting. The Mossland website provides DAO members with explanations about the governance process and uses various 3rd party solutions such as Discord and Snapshot as communication channels between DAO members. All proposals will begin with a MIP (Mossland Idea Proposal) Idea. Ideas are submitted as posts on the Discourse communication channel and must be confirmed by Moderators that they comply with DAO approved guidelines before postings are made public. In order to post Ideas or to post feedback on ideas through comments, you must go through the wallet verification process for holding Mosscoin.

## 5. What will be decided through the Mossland DAO?

Members of the Mossland DAO can discuss and decide on a variety of issues, including how to use the Mossland DAO funds, suggestions for project design/development/operation, suggestions for collaboration, and suggestions for community guidance. For example, the following items can be decided. However, proposals that contain illegal activity, hate speech, pornography, or conflict with the mission or values of the Mossland Foundation will not be voted on.

- Mossland metaverse specs and brands
- Development of detailed services in metaverse
- New service development and operation
- Marketplace Fees
- Determination of Mossland DAO Funds (Mosscoin) Allocation for Development
- Change of board of directors and management members

## 6. What about MOC(Mosscoin)?

Mossland DAO’s consensus mechanism aims to make voting fair, transparent and affordable so that Mosscoin holders can participate in the DAO’s decision-making. Submission of ideas, comments, submissions of proposals and participation in voting are restricted to Mossland DAO Members. By holding Moss Coin, you become a member of the DAO. In order to post Ideas or to post feedback on ideas through comments, you must go through the wallet verification process for holding Moss Coin.


## 7. Preparation to convert into Mossland DAO 

Mossland intends to further align the future and vision of the project, such as the operation of the Mossland Ecosystem Fund, and the project development and operation, to the direction desired by Moss Coin holders through the introduction of DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) governance.
  - Mossland DAO governance model is published on [GitHub MossDAO repo](https://github.com/mossland/MossDAO) and updated in real time.
  - In the second half of 2022, along with the release of Mossverse (Mossland Metaverse), voting for conversion from Mossland into Mossland DAO will be held.

### 7.1. Mossland Project's DAO Checklist 

Centralization Risk Checklist
1. Be able to propose changes to a system or network by the general public.
2. Allow the general public to make changes to systems or networks without the consent of the project team, or implement public proposals voted by the token holding community, regardless of whether the project team agrees to the proposal. This should also include updates to network or system code that are not supported or developed by the project team.
3. A developer who is not affiliated with the project team or is not paying for it is making significant contributions to the project. They must show that they are actively developing a network or system or are engaged in other essential tasks and responsibilities. For example) a pull request or commit in an open source repository.
4. The network or system must be actively used for its intended purpose by an individual or group not part of the project team. Example) dApps, built projects, daily active users.

Risk of active participation of the project team
1. If possible, reduce the activity of the project team so that it is no longer critical to the value or success of the project.
2. If possible, the structure should be changed so that there is no project team that the public regards as the team that centrally manages the tokens and the network.
3. Do not discuss or promote the background of the project team in token marketing.
4. If the project team is promoting widespread adoption and use of the network, it is better to stop doing so.

### 7.2. Verification of Voting Solution through CyberTHUG Portal Development 


The Mossland team has implemented the functions of suggesting ideas, voting, and checking results by developing the CyberTHUG project's Portal, and is verifying the operation. With the experience gained from the development and operation of CyberTHUG Portal, we are preparing to develop a stable Mossland DAO voting solution.

### 7.3. Mossland Metaverse (Mosverse) and voting solution

Mossland's voting solution is not only available through the website, but we are preparing to make the voting solution available on Mossland's Metaverse (Mossverse) as well.
In Mossverse, various functions will be implemented as buildings in the metaverse map, and the Mossland voting solution will be implemented as a building in the polling place.

- Estimated specifications of the polling place building
  - View voting list and details
    - View closed votes, scheduled votes, and ongoing votes list
    - View details of closed votes, scheduled votes, and ongoing votes
    - Closed votes are displayed as closed, and the result announcement view should appear for votes that have published results.
  - Voting participation function
    - Check if you own MOC in your wallet
    - Discrimination in the number of votes exercised according to the number of MOC owned
    - Vote by calling the voting function on the voting contract on the Luniverse chain with the linked Metamask wallet
